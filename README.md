# Plant Competition Optimization (PCO) Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Plant Competition Optimization (PCO) algorithm, based on the paper:

[Plant competition optimization: A novel metaheuristic algorithm for solving optimization problems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/exsy.12956)

## Description

The Plant Competition Optimization (PCO) algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization technique that mimics the competitive behavior of plants in an ecosystem. This implementation aims to solve various optimization problems using the PCO approach.

## Implementation Details

This implementation is based on the original paper and draws inspiration from the following repository:

[PCO-Plant-Competition-Optimization](https://github.com/iman-aliabdi/PCO-Plant-Competition-Optimization)

The code has been adapted and modified to suit the specific requirements of this project.

## Features

- Implementation of the PCO algorithm
- Support for various optimization problems

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/mgolfam/plant-competition-optimization.git
cd plant-competition-optimization`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
